ESS_User_Changer
================

A utility to generate an SQL script to change a user's identity in SageHRMS's Employee Self-Service Site.

It's intent was to mask a user's identity so their account could be displayed during Sage ESS training sessions.

After an interactive dialog via the console, it creates UserChanger.sql in the root of the C:\ directory.

After running the SQL script, all user data is hidden.

The USERNAME is set to the first and last name that you enter and the PASSWORD is set to Password1.
